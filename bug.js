This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and providing an invalid or inconsistent `keyExtractor` function.  The `keyExtractor` function is crucial for FlatList to efficiently update and render items. If it returns the same key for different items, or if keys are inconsistent across renders, FlatList may produce unexpected behavior, including incorrect rendering, and the error message in question.
