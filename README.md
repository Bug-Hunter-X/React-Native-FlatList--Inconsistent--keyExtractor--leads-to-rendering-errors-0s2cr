# React Native FlatList KeyExtractor Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `FlatList` component in React Native:  issues stemming from an incorrectly implemented `keyExtractor` function.

The `bug.js` file shows an example of how an invalid `keyExtractor` can cause rendering problems. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected implementation.

**Problem:** Inconsistent or duplicate keys generated by `keyExtractor` confuse FlatList's internal item tracking, leading to rendering glitches or crashes. 

**Solution:** Ensure that `keyExtractor` always returns a unique, stable identifier for each item in the data array.  This identifier should not change across renders.
